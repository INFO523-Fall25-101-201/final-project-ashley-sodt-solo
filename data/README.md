# Data

This folder contains the **processed datasets** used for the analysis.  
Raw EquiPro session CSV files are stored separately in the `Horses/` directory and
should not be modified. All processed files in this folder are generated
programmatically using the notebooks in the `analysis/` directory.

## Dataset: Session-Level Feature Matrix (`session_features.csv`)

**Description:**  
This file contains one row per exercise session and summarizes key biomechanical
variables derived from the raw stride-level EquiPro files. Each row corresponds
to a single session for one horse (Duque, Jackson, or Perseo), and each column
represents a session-level feature such as mean stride duration, symmetry
measures, or variability metrics.

This processed dataset is used for all baseline modeling, clustering, and anomaly
detection analyses.

## Variable Names and Descriptions

- **horse_id**: Identifier for the horse (“Duque”, “Jackson”, “Perseo”)
- **session_id**: Unique timestamp-based identifier derived from the filename
- **mean_stride_duration**: Average stride duration across the full session (seconds)
- **sd_stride_duration**: Standard deviation of stride duration (seconds)
- **mean_stance_duration**: Mean stance-phase duration (seconds)
- **sd_stance_duration**: Standard deviation of stance duration (seconds)
- **mean_flight_duration**: Mean flight-phase duration (seconds)
- **sd_flight_duration**: Standard deviation of flight duration (seconds)
- **mean_dap**: Mean diagonal advanced placement (meters)
- **sd_dap**: Standard deviation of diagonal advanced placement (meters)
- **mean_vertical_symmetry**: Vertical symmetry index (unitless)
- **mean_lateral_symmetry**: Lateral left–right symmetry index (unitless)
- **mean_power**: Average mechanical power (Watts)
- **sd_power**: Standard deviation of power (Watts)
- **iqr_* variables**: Interquartile range of selected features  
  (e.g., `iqr_stride_duration`, `iqr_dap`)
- **gait_phase_proportion_stance**: Proportion of time the limb spent in stance (0–1)
- **gait_phase_proportion_flight**: Proportion of time spent in flight (0–1)

## Notes

- `session_features.csv` is automatically generated by `analysis/01_features.qmd`.
- No manual editing should be done to this file.
- Raw session files live in `Horses/`.
